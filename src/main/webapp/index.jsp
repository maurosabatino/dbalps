                             Welcome,

This is the integrated information management system web interface of the dbalps, a server-side relational database that is able to manage data about natural instability processes at high-elevation sites and the related information about the main climatic parameters that are necessary for the study of these processes.

The system has been developed using free open source applications. The consultation of the database is free of charge.

Are you a hiker, a rock climber, a mountain guide, a park guard, or a manager of an alpine hut? Are you working in a mountain rescue team?

If, during your mountain activities, you have seen a rockfall or a landslide, please sends a message by using this site.
Your contribution will help us to study these processes, many thanks!
